        <p>What on <i>earth</i> is a dirty thunderstorm? And why have you not
           heard of such a thing? If you do a google image search on 'dirty
           thunderstorms', with the first image you see, you'll tell yourself
           that this is a gateway to hell. Then proceed
          to turn off the computer and try to tell yourself that it's a still
          from a movie. On the &#9788; side, it is not a movie nor a supernatural
          event. Asscosiated with volcanic eruptions, dirty thunderstorms are a
          rare weather phenomenon where lightning forms inside a volcanic plume
           (mixture of volcanic gas and particles).</p>

        <p><i>Large volcanic eruptions? How does that happen?</i>

          <br>Mainly, lightening forms when ice crystals collide and generate
           electric charges. Except in a volcanic eruption, cloud ash particles
            (i.e. rock fragments and ice particles) collide instead of ice
            crystals. Despite that lightning usually descends from storm clouds
            in the sky, dirty thunderstorms are generated within the ash cloud
            spewing from the volcano. However, this amazing and terrifying
            occurance is not fully understand by scientists as there is little
             research done because
          of how <b>dangerously</b> it effects the environment nearby, including people.

      <ul id="lightning">
        <li> Dirty thunderstorms occur regularly at the Sakurajima volcano in
           Japan, one of the most active volcanoes in the world.</li><br>
        <li>The most recently recorded occurance was 7/26/16 at Mount Sakurajima.</li><br>
        <li>Calbuco volcano, one of the most dangerous volcano in Chile, erupted
           in April 2015 for the first time in 42 years. It covered the
           surrounding areas in thick ash, forced thousands to evacuate.
           However, the dirty thunderstorm was caught on camera.
